### General conditions

This is an attempt to make a curated list of high-quality, maintained, useful geospatial software written in Rust.

- Submitting software:
  - Must either be free and open source, or have a note which explicitly states that the software is commercial. `(Commercial Software)` will do. Must have an acknowledged open source license to be exempt from the `(Commercial Software)` note requirement. I'm not a lawyer, so I'll go with the FSF listings. 
  - Libraries should be published on crates.io.

**Thank you for contributing!**
